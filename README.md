🚧 **ROAD ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS DASHBOARD**
🔍 Summer Internship Project – Analyzing road accident data to discover accident trends, hotspots, and contributing factors using Python and Streamlit.

📌 **Project Overview**
This project aims to analyze road accident data to identify:

✅ Accident distribution by location and time
📅 Monthly, weekly, and hourly accident trends
🛣️ High-risk areas or accident hotspots
🚗 Most common causes of accidents
📊 Interactive visualization of accident statistics

The dashboard was developed as part of my Summer Internship to understand patterns in road accidents and provide useful insights that could help in improving road safety and traffic planning.
